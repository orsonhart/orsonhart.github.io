    </header><p>I went back and forth on how to structure URLs for this website. On reading Derek Sivers&rsquo; post <a href="https://sive.rs/su">Short URLs: why and how</a>, I agreed with his reasons - they look nicer and are easier to type and remember - and so thought it would be good to implement his suggestions.</p>
<h2 id="domain">Domain</h2>
<p>I decided to use <code>orsonh.art</code> as a shorter (and more fun) domain name, and I was planning on using single word or abbreviated URLs. I instantly ran into my first problem. <strong>Ease of communication</strong>.</p>
<p><code>orsonh.art</code> is easier to type, but harder to communicate. As a comment on Sivers&rsquo; original post notes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Love the philosophy of short URLS. The only barrier I&rsquo;ve found is communicating them verbally</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I tried to explain my cool new URL to a handful of people, and it always took longer for them to understand than the simpler <code>orsonhart.com</code>. Another upside to using <code>orsonhart.com</code> is that <code>.com</code> is a universally recognised, and more sensible, top-level domain. A friend of mine said <em>&ldquo;orsonh.art sounds like your an artist named orsonh&rdquo;.</em></p>
<p>I did, however, drop the <code>www.</code>. It&rsquo;s much nicer.</p>
<h2 id="post-links">Post Links</h2>
<p>After writing a single post, one of the disadvantages of short URLs <a href="https://qntm.org/urls">mentioned by qntm</a> became apparent, <em>&ldquo;You do actually have to think of something.&rdquo;</em>. It is hard <em>(impossible?)</em> to write a meaningful link using very few characters. I like the fact that a slightly longer, although still concise, URL gives you information about the link you are clicking on.</p>
<p>Very few people will remember or type a URL. Most will follow a link posted elsewhere, and so I decided to prioritise</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clarity over conciseness.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Information over aesthetic.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Cleanness over clutter.</strong></li>
</ul>
