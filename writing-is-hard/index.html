    </header><p>I would love to be a good writer, but I find it very difficult to communicate my thoughts eloquently through text. I often find what I write to be clumsy and unnatural to read, and so I find it useful to edit my written thoughts by reading them out loud and correcting whatever feels strange to say. I read books that aren&rsquo;t written how someone would speak, though, so perhaps there is a voice exclusive to written form that I need to master.</p>
<p>I want this website to be a place where I can write medium to long form thoughts on topics that I find interesting. Mainly as a way to practice writing, but also because sometimes I might think my ideas are actually worth sharing. Some of these ideas are maths adjacent, mainly relating to how I study mathematics effectively, and I think these will probably be easiest for me to write because it&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m most familiar with.</p>
<p>I know the best way to improve my writing will just be to practice writing more, but I also feel like I don&rsquo;t want to write <em>bad</em> thoughts either. I think it is probably best to just bite the bullet and <strong>just write</strong>.</p>
